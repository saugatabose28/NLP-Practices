Overview
--------

This repository contains practical experiments, tutorials, and coding examples related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). It includes implementations of fundamental NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, word embeddings, sentiment analysis, text classification, and deep learning models for NLP tasks.

Repository Contents
-------------------

### 1\. **Text Preprocessing and Cleaning**

*   Techniques for text normalization, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization using libraries such as NLTK and spaCy.
    

### 2\. **Word Embeddings**

*   Implementation and exploration of Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText embeddings.
    
*   Visualizations of embeddings using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE.
    

### 3\. **Text Classification**

*   Application of classical machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression) for sentiment analysis and topic classification.
    
*   Deep learning-based classifiers (CNN, RNN, LSTM, and BERT) using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
    

### 4\. **Sentiment Analysis**

*   Techniques to analyze sentiment from textual data.
    
*   Building and evaluating sentiment classification models.
    

### 5\. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

*   Identifying entities within text using pre-trained models and fine-tuning custom models.
    

### 6\. **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**

*   Implementation of translation and summarization tasks using LSTM and Transformer architectures.
