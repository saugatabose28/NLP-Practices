Lab 9

This week we will try two annotation tools: Label Studio and SLATE. Both are open source projects, but differ significantly in approach:

Label Studio provides a GUI with all sorts of special features.

SLATE is a purely terminal-based tool, with a limited feature set.

We will be doing the following:

Automatically labelling some data with Named Entities using spaCy.

Manually editing those labels to correct errors.

Measuring the overall accuracy of the spaCy output.

The goal of this lab is to give you some familiarity with annotation tools. Creating annotated data is an essential part of NLP, both for research and applications.

If you have issues when getting them set up, see the 'Setup Tips' page in this lesson.

For both, we will be using data from the podcast This American Life. The version we will use is in this Ed Lesson on the next slide. it is based on data from here. The Label Studio part of the lab is based on this tutorial by the Label Studio developers.

You should look at every occurrence of 'Sydney' and make sure it is labeled correctly (adding and removing labels as needed). Leave all other labels alone. The correct labels should be:

... and that [PERSON Sydney Poitier] babysat in ...

... man named [PERSON Sydney Diamond], a lieutenant.

... I love [PERSON Sydney Diamond] and his fiancee Estelle Spiro. And [PERSON Sydney] ...  And [PERSON Sydney] was gung

... the TV show [WORK_OF_ART Love, Sydney] with Tony ...

... Amsterdam, and [GPE Sydney]. And the ... called the [GPE Sydney] Tourist Bureau ...  they said, [GPE Sydney] says they're ...

...  explains the [PERSON Sydney] situation.

[PERSON Sydney] is my friend at the mall who ditched me for her boyfriend.

...  And every [PERSON Sydney Poitier] movie that ...

... leader in [GPE Sydney] was prosecuted ...

Setup

Open a terminal.

Create a folder for this task, move into it, and print the location so you know where you need to save files:

mkdir comp4446-5046_lab9
cd comp4446-5046_lab9
pwd

Set up a virtual environment by running this commands:

python3 -m venv env-comp5046-lab9


Then, on Mac / Linux, activate it with:

source env-comp5046-lab9/bin/activate

Or, on Windows, activate it with:

.\env-comp5046-lab9\Scripts\activate


Note, if at any point in this lab you lose your terminal / need to restart / etc, you can get back into this environment as follows:

Open a terminal

cd comp4446-5046_lab9

source env-comp5046-lab9/bin/activate
or
.\env-comp5046-lab9\Scripts\activate

Next, install dependencies:

python3 -m pip install -U pip
pip install -U spacy pandas label-studio


Get two spaCy models (note that this may take a few minutes):

python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg


Next, we label the data using spaCy.

First, download this script and save it in the folder printed by the pwd command above.



Next, download this data, also saving it where you are:



Then run the program as follows:

python3 label-with-spacy.py


Create a project in label studio. When prompted for an email address and password, make up any one you want:

label-studio init ner-tagging


Annotation

Run label studio:

label-studio start ner-tagging


On some computers, the command above will open a browser window. If it does not for you then open a browser and go to:

http://0.0.0.0:8080/


Create an account:



This should show you a page like this:



Open your project and import the data in tasks.json created by the label-with-spacy.py script.

From the project in Label Studio, click the following buttons:

Settings (top right)

Labelling Interface (top left)

Browse Templates

Natural Language Processing

Named Entity Recognition

Adjust the labels by removing the ones that are there and adding:

CARDINAL
DATE
GPE
LANGUAGE
NORP
ORDINAL
ORG
PERSON
TIME
WORK_OF_ART


Select 'Label All Tasks'. Go through each one, checking the labels for 'Sydney' and fixing them as needed. You can select a label by clicking on it and then change it by selecting a different label at the top, or delete it with the red rubbish bin icon on the right.

Export the data

Click Export (top right)

Select JSON

Save as annotations.json

Evaluate

Download this file:



Run it like so to see how spaCy's output compares with your annotations:

python3 label-studio-evaluate.py

Your results should be between 85 and 92.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Data

We will be using the same data as from the previous step. We also assume the code from the previous step has been run.

Setup

For this we will use Amazon Sagemaker Studio Lab (you can use your own computer if you like, but may experience issues, particularly if you are on Windows).

In Sagemaker, do the following:

Start your instance, using CPU

Press the purple plus button in the top left

Select 'Terminal' in the bottom row of options

Change to 'dark mode' by going to Settings (top) => Theme => JupyterLab Dark

Install slate (you can reuse the virtual environment from earlier or not - either is fine):

pip install slate-nlp


Upload two files. You will need to download these to your computer, then upload them to Sagemaker.

First, a configuration file for SLATE:





And code to prepare the data:



Which you should run like so:

python3 prepare-for-slate.py


Annotation

First, you will learn how to do annotation in SLATE. Download this file:



Then run the tutorial like so:

slate slate-ner.md -t categorical -s token -o -c ner.config -l log.tutorial.ner.txt -sl -sm


Once you are done with the tutorial, type q to quit.

After that, you are ready to do annotation. You can do that like so:

slate -d data-for-slate.file-list.txt -c ner.config -t categorical -s token -o -l log.tutorial.ner.txt -sl -sm


Note that annotations are auto-saved, so when you are done you can simply quit.

And finally you can evaluate again:



python3 slate-evaluate.py

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have trouble getting either annotation tool set up, try looking at the advice below. Thank you for the students who shared these solutions!

Windows

Error that mentions psycopg2 

Use python 3.12.3

Download and install postgresSQL from here: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

pip install psycopg2
