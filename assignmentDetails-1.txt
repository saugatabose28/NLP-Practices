In this assignment you will implement a range of ngram-based language models and language model components.

All parts are equally weighted (a third of a mark each).

Unless stated otherwise, always follow these instructions when reading data:

Split words on whitespace

Do not separate punctuation from words

Do not add special markers for the start and end of lines, start and end of sentences, or other boundaries

Ngrams should not extend across line boundaries

When the output is a probability, we will accept values within 1e-5 of the true value (since comparing floating point numbers exactly could be misleading).

You may use the following Python builtin libraries:

math

collections

You may not install any additional packages or use other libraries. If you believe there is a builtin library that is essential, you may email Jonathan to request it be added to the list above.
